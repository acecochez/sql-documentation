      <header>What is SQL</header>
      <p class="paragraph">SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a special language used to communicate with databases. Think of a database as a giant digital filing cabinet that stores all kinds of information, like customer data, product details, or sales records. SQL helps us ask questions and get answers from this filing cabinet. For example, if you want to know how many items were sold last month, you can use SQL to get that information quickly.</p>
      <!-- CODE -->
      <code><span class="b">SELECT</span> <span class="o">COUNT</span>(*) <span class="b">FROM</span> Sales <span class="b">WHERE</span> SaleDate >= <span class="g">'2023-10-01'</span> <span class="b">AND</span> SaleDate <= <span class="g">'2023-10-31';</span></code>
      <!-- SUMMARY -->
      <p class="summary">Summary: SQL is a language that helps retrieve and manage data stored in databases.</p>

    <!-- HOW SQL WORKS -->
    <section class="main-section" id="How_SQL_works">
      <header>How SQL works</header>
        <p class="paragraph">SQL works by using simple commands, much like giving instructions. These commands help you do different things with the data. For instance, you can SELECT information to view it, INSERT new data to add it, UPDATE existing data to change it, or DELETE data you no longer need. Each command tells the database exactly what action to perform, making it easier to manage and organize large amounts of data.</p>
      <!-- CODE -->
      <li>SELECT: View data.</li>
      <code><span class="b">SELECT</span> * <span class="b">FROM</span> Customers <span class="b">WHERE</span> City = <span class="g">'New York'</span>;</code>

      <li>INSERT: Add new data.</li>
      <code><span class="b">INSERT INTO</span> Customers (Name, City) <span class="b">VALUES</span> (<span class="g">'John Doe'</span>, <span class="g">'Los Angeles'</span>);</code>
      <!-- SUMMARY -->
      <p class="summary">Summary: SQL uses commands to perform tasks like viewing, adding, updating, or deleting data.</p>

      <header>Why SQL is important</header>
        <p class="paragraph">SQL is important because it makes handling data efficient and straightforward. Businesses and organizations collect huge amounts of data every day, and they need a way to analyze and make sense of it. SQL helps by providing tools to filter, sort, and summarize data. Whether it's finding trends, creating reports, or making better decisions, SQL plays a crucial role in turning raw data into useful information.</p>
      <!-- CODE -->
      <li>Example:</li>
      <code><span class="b">SELECT</span> <span class="o">AVG</span>(Salary) <span class="b">FROM</span> Employees <span class="b">WHERE</span> Department = <span class="g">'Sales'</span>;</code>
